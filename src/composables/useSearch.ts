 * - Will be extended later for filtering, debouncing, and offline search.
 * - All types and state are documented for learning and maintainability.

// ===== Main Logic =====

 * useSearch composable
 * - Returns a reactive search query (static for now).
 * - Will later include filtering, debouncing, and offline search logic.

/*
  ===== Educational Notes =====
  - This composable is static for now (sst).
  - All state is local and does not persist.
  - In future steps, we will add:
    - Filtering logic for notes and folders
    - Debounced search for performance
    - Offline search support
    - Error handling for Ghanaian connectivity
